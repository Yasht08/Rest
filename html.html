                                <p>These teriyaki pineapple meatballs appetizer changed so many times because of my families suggestions that it eventually became a main course. I think the homemade sauce sets these meatballs apart. —Evette Nowicki, Oak Harbor, Washington</p>

                            <p>One taste of this outrageously delicious hot spinach artichoke dip and your guests will not stop eating it until it is gone. The savory blend of artichokes, spinach and Parmesan cheese is positively addictive! It tastes even better if you make it the night before and chill it in the fridge before baking. —Michelle Krzmarzick, Torrance, California</p>
